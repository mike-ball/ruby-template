# ruby-template

This is a simple template to use for Ruby projects and TDD.

To make it even simpler, add this line to your .bash_profile

`alias nr='git clone git@github.com:mike-ball/ruby-template.git .;git remote rm origin;' # start a new Ruby project (not rails)`

After that, use your Mac/Linux terminal to move into a new directory, and call.

`nr`

It's that easy!
